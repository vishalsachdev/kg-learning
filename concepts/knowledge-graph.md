# Knowledge Graph

- **id**: concept:knowledge-graph
- **level**: foundational
- **aliases**: [KG, knowledge base, semantic graph]

## Definition

A **knowledge graph** is a structured representation of knowledge that connects entities (nodes) through defined relationships (edges), creating a unified model of a domain. It captures both facts and their semantic context, enabling machines and humans to reason over connected data.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Entities as Nodes**: Real-world objects, concepts, or events represented as vertices
2. **Relationships as Edges**: Named, typed connections between entities
3. **Properties**: Attributes attached to nodes and edges
4. **Schema/Ontology**: Formal definition of types and allowed relationships

## Why It Matters

- Provides **semantic grounding** for AI systems
- Enables **disambiguation** (distinguishing Apple Inc. from apple fruit)
- Supports **explainable reasoning** through traversable paths
- Creates **reusable knowledge** across applications

## Examples

- Google Knowledge Graph (web search)
- Wikidata (open knowledge base)
- Enterprise knowledge graphs (internal organizational knowledge)

## Related Concepts
