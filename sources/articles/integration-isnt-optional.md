## Summary

Data integration is a critical—not optional—foundation for AI-ready systems. Integration becomes strategically central when organizations deploy intelligent agents.

## Core Thesis

> "The Semantic Web is not the problem"—distributed data integration poses the genuine complexity challenge.

Postponing integration solutions creates compounding costs over time.

## Key Requirements for Intelligent Systems

Effective AI agents require two foundational elements:
1. **Consistent semantic frameworks**
2. **Connected data networks**

## Key Concepts Explained

| Concept | Role |
|---------|------|
| **URIs** | Stable identity markers for entities |
| **Ontologies** | Shared meaning across data sources |
| **Knowledge Graphs** | Connectivity layer requiring semantic enhancement |
| **DPROD** | Specification for publishing data products with integrated semantics |

## The Bug Metaphor

Integration challenges mirror software bugs—addressing them early minimizes risk and expense. Deferring solutions burdens future AI agents through virtualization layer complications.

## Key Takeaway

URIs and ontologies are not optional extras—they are prerequisites for AI-ready data infrastructure.
