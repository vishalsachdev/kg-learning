## Summary

Major organizations (SAP, Netflix, ServiceNow, Samsung) are adopting knowledge graphs as foundational infrastructure rather than optional technology. This represents a fundamental awakening to their strategic value.

## Three Core Drivers

1. **AI Requires Context**: Generative AI systems need structured, contextual foundations for accurate, explainable results

2. **Data Fragmentation Problem**: Organizations suffer from scattered schemas and duplicated logic. KGs unify meaning across the enterprise

3. **Semantic Accessibility**: Business users benefit from a semantic layer enabling natural question-answering

## Industry Applications

| Sector | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Pharmaceuticals | Long-standing deployments |
| Investment Banking | Dedicated graph teams |
| Manufacturing | Digital twin implementations |
| Legal | Neural-symbolic use cases |
| Retail | Widespread interest |
| Cloud Providers | Graph-native tooling competition |

## Implementation Guidance

- Begin modestly with domain-specific applications
- Define core business concepts systematically
- Leverage existing data assets
- Maintain commitment to open standards
- Avoid treating graphs as universal solutions

## Key Quote

> "You need to connect your data. You need to organise it by business semantics."

## Key Takeaway

In an AI-driven future, possessing data alone is insufficient—organizations require structured knowledge systems to remain competitive.
